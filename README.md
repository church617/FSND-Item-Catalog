# FSND-project-4

This is the 4th project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree course. This is a Item Catalog website that uses a custom built API for JSON queries to a database that returns the data to an HTML webpage. These webpages include links that implement CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions that are done through calls to the API.

This webpage will require the following programs to be installed in order to run:
  Vagrant
  Oracle VM virtualbox
  Gitbash or similar program.
  Python Version 2.7 or later

To run the webpage the following steps need to be taken:
  1st, clone to a local repository
  2nd, open Gitbash(or similar program) and run a vagrant up command to setup the Vagrant environment in a virtual environment
  3rd, run a vagrant ssh to login and then navigate to the vagrant directory
  then run the database_setup.py, database_populate.py, and application.py files to setup the database and run the website
